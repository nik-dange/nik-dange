### 👋 Hi there, I'm Nikhil!

I'm currently a third year Computer Engineering major at UC San Diego! I have a strong interest in back-end software engineering, and have been spending time learning about how to build scalable solutions to complex problems.

- 💻 I'm an incoming Software Engineering Intern at Walmart Global Tech
- 🏝 I'm a Technical Event Host & Software Engineer for ACM @ UCSD
