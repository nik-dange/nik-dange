### 👋 Hi there, I'm Nikhil!

I'm currently a fourth year Computer Engineering student at UC San Diego! I have a strong interest in back-end software engineering and distributed systems, and have been spending time learning about how to build scalable solutions for complex problems.

Here's a few things that are currently going on:

- 🛒 I just finished up my software engineering internship at [Walmart Global Tech](https://tech.walmart.com/content/walmart-global-tech/en_us.html), where I was working on enhancing [Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org) functionality on the Walmart+ Backend Platform Team.

- 🖥️ I'm leading [ACM Hack](https://hack.acmucsd.com), a community at the [Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) @ UCSD](https://acmucsd.com) centered around software engineering and exploring what's possible through code. I host technical workshops, organize bootcamps, and help grow the developer community at UC San Diego. Check us out at [hack.acmucsd.com](https://hack.acmucsd.com)!

- 💻 I'm also on the development team at ACM @ UCSD–specifically, the back-end development team, where I contribute to our [membership portal API](https://github.com/acmucsd/membership-portal). You can see it in action [here](https://members.acmucsd.com/login)!

- ✏️ I'm a software engineer at [KeyNode Solutions](https://www.keynodesolutions.com), working on building custom Salesforce automations and solutions for clients.
